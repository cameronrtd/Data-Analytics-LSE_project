# Data Analytics Project: Turtle Games Customer Insights Project
In the summer of 2024 I began my studies of data analytics with LSE. This repository will showcase my ongoing learning and application of skills. 

## The Data
The data used is not real world data; it is randomly generated data for a fictional company as a means of applying knowledge gained from the course. However, the demonstration of my application of data analysis, particularly machine learning techniques, is what motivated this project. 

## Project Overview
Key business objectives:
  1. **Customer Engagement with Loyalty Points**: Analyse how customers accumulate loyalty points.
  2. **Customer Segmentation**: Identify customer segments to inform targeted marketing strategies.
  3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyse customer review sentiment to inform business and marketing decisions.

## Approach
### Data Cleaning
Ensuring data has no null values and removing redundant columns.
### Techniques and Models

| Machine Learning Technique |            Obective             |
----------------------------------------------------------------
| **Multiple Linear Regression (OLS)** | Understanding the determinants of loyalty points. |
| **Decision Tree Regression** | Better understand loyalty drivers. |
