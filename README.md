# Data Analytics Project
In the summer of 2024 I began my studies of data analytics with LSE. This repository will showcase my ongoing learning and application of skills. 

## The Data
The data used is not real world data; it is randomly generated data for a fictional company as a means of applying knowledge gained from the course. However, the demonstration of my application of data analysis, particularly machine learning techniques, is what motivated this project.
